# What is this program?
This is meant to be a little bit faster and a little bit unobtrusive aid for day to day eve online related gameplay. Currently, local analyzer copied into clipboard is working.

# How to use?
* `alt+shift+f` - toggle transparency
    * once a window is not transparent, you can click on individual pilot names to open their zkillboard.
* `alt+shift+m` - toggle aggregated mode -> this will show you aggregated info about all pilots in your local, instead of individual info about each pilot
* `alt+shift+e` - clear cache

The shortcut keys can be customized in the config.yaml file.
